**Content:**

- Vehicle must be insured with Westpac noted as an interested party; insurance details loaded in QuickSell / DriveOnline
- Vehicle tax invoice or private sale agreement

**Certificate of Currency (CoC) — assets above $150k:**
- CoC required to confirm insurance details
- Must note Westpac's interest
- **Updated rule (effective 24 February 2025):** Where the CoC confirms the policy is a "fleet policy", there is no longer a requirement to include the specific asset VIN/serial number on the CoC. Applies to motor vehicles only — does not apply to any other asset types.

**PPSR — Updated rule (effective 24 February 2025):**
Where the financed asset is a motor vehicle with a VIN and the sale is a buyback or private sale:
- A PPSR company search over the private seller or customer is **no longer required**
- This removes the need for a PPSR deed of release in most cases

**Conditions for PPSR exemption:**
- The asset must have a VIN (all other serial number types such as PIN, HIN, VH number etc. follow the existing process)
- A search on the day before or the day of the sale/lease must not disclose another registration over that VIN
