**trigger_words:** flexi mid-term refinancing, flexi Low Start Loan, flexi 50% repayments, Old Finance Meets New, flexi bundled refinance, flexi cash flow, flexi 1% brokerage refinance

**Content:**

flexicommercial offers three cash-flow-focused refinancing and repayment products.

**Mid-term Refinancing** — refinancing framework:
- At least **12 months** into the term of the current contract
- Terms of up to 5 years considered
- Satisfactory repayment history with no material arrears. A small number of non-systemic dishonours may be acceptable
- Deal to be refinanced at the net book value — that is, no early termination costs to apply
- Standard interest rates apply
- Mid-term refinances are subject to normal flexicommercial credit policy
- **Brokerage limited to 1.0%** (speak to your flexi BDM if the complexity of the deal warrants a higher brokerage)

**flexipremium Low Start Loans** — an easier start with 50% repayments:
- For new flexipremium facilities, a Low Start Loan lets the business start their term paying **50% repayments for the first 3 months**, then catch that up gradually over time
- Conditions:
  - Customer must qualify for flexipremium
  - No cashflow lenders on file (e.g. Prospa, Moula)
  - Must have an existing commercial asset finance facility with an approved lender

*Example:* $500K for a new excavator over 60 months (with a 20% residual) — standard repayments $8,400/month; Low Start repayments $4,200/month for the first 3 months, then catch-up repayments of $9,196/month thereafter.

**Old Finance Meets New** — bundling an existing finance agreement into a new contract with additional equipment, allowing a business to both pay off their existing asset and purchase a new one, with the net result of reduced repayments.

*Example:* an existing excavator with $2,075/month repayments, 2 years to go and a $46K payout, bundled into a new $146K, 5-year facility for 2 excavators with a new repayment of $3,029/month.
