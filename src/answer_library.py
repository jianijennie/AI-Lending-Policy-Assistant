"""Persisted store of human-reviewed/corrected answers, served back at
query time and kept in sync with the chunks they were based on.

The frontend's Review tab already lets a reviewer edit an AI-generated
answer before approving it -- that's the "correct the chatbot" step. What
was missing: approved answers were only ever written to
answer_library.json, never read back, so a correction only ever benefited
whoever happened to still have it in their browser's session state. And
nothing tracked whether the chunk an approved answer was based on later
changed underneath it (a rate update, a threshold correction) -- a stale
correction would otherwise keep being served with no signal to anyone.

This module is the fix: save_entry() snapshots the exact chunk content an
answer depended on at approval time; find_best_match() serves matching
entries back at query time; and refresh_stale_entries() re-checks snapshots
against current chunk content whenever chunks change, using a narrow LLM
call (src.query.refresh_answer_with_new_chunk) to update just the outdated
numbers rather than silently keep serving something that no longer holds.

find_best_match()'s matching is two-stage, same as the query cache in
src/api.py (see QUERY_CACHE_PREFILTER_THRESHOLD's comment in config.py for
the calibration data behind this): embedding similarity alone doesn't
reliably separate genuine paraphrases from same-wording-different-detail
questions in this domain ("BFS Tier 2" vs "BFS Tier 3" scored higher than
several genuine paraphrase pairs), so it's used only as a cheap pre-filter.
The actual yes/no gate is src.query.questions_require_same_answer(), a
direct LLM comparison -- a wrongly-matched *human correction* would be just
as bad a failure as a wrongly-matched raw cache hit, so this gets the same
scrutiny even though every entry here already cleared a human review step.
