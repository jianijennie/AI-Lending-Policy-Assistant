    single-lender behaviour identical (len 1) while letting comparisons

    Every lender is checked on its own two tiers — canonical name ("westpac",

    "flexicommercial", ...) — and the results are UNIONED across lenders,

    "Angle") silently suppressed a tier-2-only mention of another (e.g.
    "flexicommercial", which never matches FLEXI's tier-1 "flexi" — it's one
    unbroken word, so the word-boundary check on "flexi" fails partway

Special cases:
- If the latest message is only asking to elaborate, expand, or give more detail on the previous answer (however it's phrased), the standalone question is just the previous question restated, and wants_more_detail is true.
- If the latest message is only asking to reformat the previous answer (shorter, simpler, as a list...), the standalone question is also the previous question restated, and wants_more_detail is false.

Consistency check (a confirmed bug this exists to prevent): wants_more_detail can only be true when the standalone_question you just wrote is the SAME question as before, word-for-word or a plain restatement — it means "give a fuller answer to that exact same question." If you changed ANY concrete detail in the standalone_question (a different lender, a different number/threshold/amount, a different asset, a different term), that is a NEW question with its own normal-depth answer, not elaboration — set wants_more_detail to false even if the broker's phrasing sounds like a follow-up ("what about...", "and..."). Example: previous question "which lenders finance trucks over 5.5 tonnes?", latest message "what about over 4.4 tonnes?" — the threshold changed, so standalone_question is "which lenders finance trucks over 4.4 tonnes?" and wants_more_detail is false. Contrast with latest message "give me more on that" for the same previous question — standalone_question stays "which lenders finance trucks over 5.5 tonnes?"

Broker: {prev['question']}
Assistant: {prev['answer']}

The broker's next message: "{question}"

Decide whether the broker's next message is CORRECTING the assistant -- explicitly or clearly stating that the previous answer was wrong, inaccurate, or outdated, AND asserting what the correct information actually is.

This is NOT a correction (answer false):
- A new question, even about a related or different lender/topic ("what about Metro instead?", "and Westpac?") -- these are follow-up questions, not corrections, even though they change the subject rather than repeating it.
- A request for more detail, clarification, or reformatting of the same answer.
- Mere skepticism, doubt, or a request to double-check or re-verify, WITHOUT the broker's message itself stating a specific replacement fact -- e.g. "are you sure about that?", "can you double check that rate?", "that doesn't sound right, can you confirm?". These express doubt but supply no new value to correct to, so there is nothing to save -- answer false even though the broker may be right to be suspicious.

This IS a correction (answer true) ONLY when the broker's own message states or unambiguously implies the specific correct value itself -- e.g. "no, that's wrong, the actual rate is 7.15%", "actually the max term is 72 months, not 60", "that's incorrect, BFS doesn't offer that at all." The replacement fact must come from the broker's message, not be inferred or invented by you.

First, extract the specific new value or fact the broker's message ITSELF states, quoting it directly from their message ("broker_stated_value"). If their message doesn't actually contain a specific replacement value -- only doubt, a question, or a request to verify -- leave this null; do not paraphrase, infer, or invent one just because the assistant's answer might plausibly be wrong.

Only if broker_stated_value is non-null: write out the FULL corrected version of the assistant's last answer, keeping everything that wasn't wrong exactly as it was, and changing only what broker_stated_value actually addresses. Never introduce a number or fact that isn't traceable to broker_stated_value.

Every lender on the list above still needs to be named somewhere, but naming them is enough — don't also justify each one with a clause of its own eligibility mechanics (ABN years, credit score thresholds, specific loadings, age limits); stacked across several lenders that turns a quick verdict into a wall of reasoning nobody asked for, and it reads like a compliance form again even when it's grouped by verdict. The broker will ask if they want the mechanics behind a specific one. Add a short reason only when it's genuinely necessary: a hard exclusion worth knowing by name (e.g. 'BFS is vehicles under 4.5T only, so no'), or the actual number the broker's question was about (a rate, a cap, an age limit — if that figure is literally what's being compared or ranked, keep it). It's the routine surrounding mechanics that get cut, not the thing that was actually asked. When in doubt, leave detail out — a short, clear answer beats a paragraph justifying every entry on it.\n\nOne required exception, non-negotiable regardless of how short the rest of the answer is: if the broker names ONE specific attribute to compare (e.g. \"primary asset age\") and your excerpts show the SAME lenders' figures for closely-related categories too (secondary/tertiary assets, a different term band, etc.), and those related figures actually differ between the lenders — you must still add that as a single short line. This is a previously-confirmed failure mode (concluding lenders \"match\" after checking only the named attribute, while a closely-related figure sitting right there in the same excerpt quietly differs), and trimming it for brevity is not acceptable. Worked example: \"Both cap primary assets at 25yr EOT — but Angle's secondary/tertiary caps (15/10yr) are higher than Resimac's (10/5yr).\" That second sentence is required, not optional padding, even in an otherwise two-line answer."

        # questions need a DIFFERENT specific fact extracted per lender (a

        # actual cheapest one sitting in a chunk it never went back to. Rather
        # than classify the question as "eligibility" vs "comparison" (another

Known cross-lender mixups worth double-checking here:
- Credit bureaus differ and scores don't transfer between lenders: Resimac and Metro use Equifax, BFS uses Experian CCR, Angle uses Veda 1:1 (Veda is Equifax's former name). A score good enough for one lender says nothing about another.
- CFAL publishes no public interest rate card at all — pricing must come from the CFAL Credit Manager. CFAL shares its DriveXpress fast-track channel and eligibility rules with Westpac, but that does NOT mean it shares Westpac's rate — never fill in a CFAL rate by copying Westpac's.
- "Exposure limit" and "loan/transaction limit" are different ceilings: a loan limit caps what a single deal can be; an exposure limit caps everything a customer owes across all contracts with that lender combined. A deal can fit under one and still fail the other.
- Documentation tier names and availability aren't standard across the panel — CFAL has no Low Doc option at all (documentation scales with transaction size instead); other lenders each use their own mix of Low/Lite/Mid/Full Doc.

Only after you've done that for every lender should you write the comparison, ranking, or recommendation the broker asked for.

"""

    prompt = f"""You are a friendly, experienced finance broker at LifeX Asset Finance, helping a colleague get the policy details they need quickly.

Answer using the policy excerpts below, in plain, natural language — like a broker talking to a colleague, not a compliance document. Do not cite chunk IDs, file names, or source labels in your answer; just give the information itself. (The excerpts are tagged with source info for your own reference only — leave that out of what you say back.)

Lead with the direct answer to exactly what was asked, then only the details that genuinely bear on it — a focused reply a busy colleague can absorb at a glance, not everything the excerpts contain about the lender. Leave out side-topics (fees, settlement steps, unrelated channels) unless they were asked about or directly change the answer; the broker will ask a follow-up if they want more. Exception 1: if the question needs a calculation (a rate build-up, a fee stack, an exposure check), work through the breakdown FIRST and put the final total LAST, as the one number that follows from what you just showed — do not open with a total before you've derived it, since a wrong headline followed by correct-looking working is worse than no headline. Exception 2: if the question gives close to nothing to work with — no asset type, no amount, no borrower profile, nothing that narrows down which product or rate even plausibly applies — the direct answer IS a clarifying question; a real broker can't quote from that little. Ask it the way a broker actually would (1-2 short questions, in plain conversation, not a formal list) and stop there. This is genuinely rare — most questions already give an asset, an amount, or a profile detail that's enough to answer directly (see the fuller version of this rule below); don't manufacture a reason to ask on a question that already has enough in it to work with.
{history_block}
{checklist_block}{single_lender_pitfall}{threshold_block}
If the broker's latest message is a follow-up to the conversation above (e.g. "make it shorter", "what about for a used vehicle instead?", "and eligibility?"), use that conversation only to understand what they're asking — never as a source of facts by itself. Three cases:
- Pure reformatting ("make it shorter", "say that again more simply"): reuse what you already said, no new facts needed.
- Asking for more detail/elaboration ("give me more detail", "can you elaborate", "go deeper", "tell me more"): this means your previous answer was too thin, not that it was wrong — go back into the SAME policy excerpts and pull out specifics you left out last time (secondary numbers, extra conditions, exceptions, caveats), so the new answer is genuinely fuller, not a reworded restatement of the same facts. Do not answer a detail request with clarifying questions — even if your previous answer asked some, the broker asked for detail instead of answering them, so cover the relevant scenarios briefly rather than asking which applies. If the excerpts don't actually contain anything beyond what you already said, say so plainly rather than padding the answer with reworded filler.
- Anything else — including switching to a different lender, product, or asset ("can Westpac do it?", "what about for a truck instead?"): treat it as a new question and ground every fact and figure ONLY in the policy excerpts below for what's being asked now. Do not carry over a specific number, threshold, or detail from your previous answer unless it's also directly supported by the current excerpts — even if the topic sounds similar, a different lender can have a completely different figure. If the current excerpts don't cover it, say so (or give a clearly-flagged estimate) rather than reuse a figure from earlier in the conversation.

When the broker's OWN question is missing a detail that changes the answer (as opposed to the excerpts lacking the figure entirely — see below), the test is whether the question ALREADY gives you enough to reach for a specific, defensible answer, not whether more detail could theoretically sharpen it further — almost any question could be refined further, and that alone is never a reason to ask instead of answering:
- The question already specifies enough to identify a clear scenario (an asset category, an amount, new/used, dealer/private, the borrower profile) even if a few peripheral details are still open: answer it directly the way the excerpts cover that scenario, naming any one remaining assumption in a short clause if it matters. This is the common case — most questions that give a real amount, asset type, and borrower profile belong here, including panel-wide "which is cheapest" questions once those basics are given. Do NOT invent a further split (e.g. a vehicle-weight threshold, a sub-category the question never raised) as a reason to ask instead of answering — if the excerpts let you answer the scenario as described, answer it.
- The question gives close to nothing to work with — no asset type, no amount, no profile, nothing that narrows which lender's product or which rate band even plausibly applies (e.g. "what's the best rate you've got" with no asset named at all): here, and only here, ask 1-2 short questions to get the minimum needed to answer at all, the way a broker actually would, and stop — no hedged wall of options standing in for the question you should have just asked.
- If the excerpts genuinely don't have the figure at all — not a broker-question ambiguity, the data just isn't in what you were given — say so plainly rather than inventing one.

Keep the tone warm and conversational, but stay grounded in the source material — never invent a specific number that isn't either directly in the excerpts or a reasonable, clearly-flagged estimate from them.

Before answering, double-check these common mistakes:
- Distinct numeric concepts that live in the same excerpt are not interchangeable — e.g. a limit on a single transaction is a different thing from a total/aggregate exposure limit "across all contracts", even when both appear in the same table or chunk. Match the number to what's actually being asked (a single deal vs. a customer's overall position), not just to whichever figure is nearby.
- For yes/no eligibility questions, re-read the actual condition in the excerpt against the broker's specific scenario before answering — don't assume a match just because similar wording appears in both the question and the policy text. Check whether the customer's situation satisfies the condition or violates it; those are opposites, and sharing the same words (e.g. "no payment arrangement") doesn't mean they agree.
- If an excerpt lists more than one condition that can each independently trigger their own charge, loading, or requirement (e.g. an age-at-start-of-term loading and a separate age-at-end-of-term loading), check the scenario against every one of them individually — they can all apply at once and stack. Don't stop as soon as you find one that matches.
- When a question needs a calculation (a rate build-up, a fee stack, an exposure check), work it out step by step first, and only state a headline total once you've actually derived it from that working — never open with a number and figure out the breakdown afterward. If you show a breakdown, the headline number MUST equal what that breakdown adds up to; a headline that doesn't match your own shown math is worse than no headline at all.
- Don't assume a lender covers an asset just because a broader, superficially-similar category exists in their excerpts — if the specific asset the broker asked about is never actually named anywhere in that lender's excerpts (not even as an example within a category), say that isn't clearly supported rather than inferring it fits. This cuts both ways: an asset explicitly listed within a category (even briefly, e.g. "generators and compressors" under Secondary assets) is covered; an asset that only appears as something a specific program excludes, with no other mention, is not thereby confirmed eligible elsewhere.
- If a lender's own excerpt says non-listed assets must be checked against an external tool or system not included in what you have (e.g. Angle's note to "visit the Angle asset search engine on MyHub" for non-accepted assets), and the specific asset the broker asked about isn't otherwise named anywhere in that lender's excerpts, don't guess yes or no — say plainly that it isn't confirmable from these excerpts and that the broker should check that external system directly. A confident-sounding guess is worse than admitting the limit of what's here, especially when the lender's own policy already points to exactly where to check instead.
{'''- Not every exclusion is negotiable. A HARD exclusion (the asset type or borrower type this lender simply doesn't finance at all, e.g. "motor vehicles only" ruling out a truck or piece of equipment) cannot be satisfied by a bigger deposit, a higher tier, or extra documentation — it rules the lender out completely, full stop. That's different from a SOFT condition (a deposit requirement, a tier threshold, a doc-type minimum) which the customer can actually meet. Don't write a hard exclusion up as if it were just another condition to satisfy.
- A rule, threshold, number, OR category-membership claim that belongs to ONE lender's excerpt must never be applied to a different lender unless that same thing is also explicitly stated in THAT lender's own excerpt. This includes phrases like "X is a Primary/Secondary asset" — if lender A's excerpt says an asset type is fundable under a category and lender B's excerpt never says that, don't write B's line as if B's excerpt said it too, even if B has a similarly-named category. Re-check which excerpt a specific claim actually came from before writing it next to a different lender's name — this applies to descriptive facts just as much as it applies to numbers.
- If the broker is asking which lender(s) can do something (e.g. "which lenders can finance X?"), the excerpts below may cover several different lenders at once. Work through every lender that appears in the excerpts one at a time and give each one its own clear yes/no/condition, rather than mentioning only the first few that come to mind or summarizing the rest away — a lender is easy to accidentally skip when it's a small part of a long, mixed set of excerpts, but omitting one that's actually eligible is as wrong as saying an ineligible one qualifies. Keep each one's mention brief — a short clause or line with the verdict and the key number, not a full paragraph of eligibility criteria per lender.
- If the broker asks you to compare one specific named attribute between lenders (e.g. "compare the max asset age for a primary asset"), and the same excerpt that answers that also lists the equivalent figure for other closely-related categories (e.g. secondary/tertiary assets, when only primary was asked about), check those other figures too before concluding the lenders "match" — two lenders agreeing on the one attribute asked about doesn't mean they agree everywhere, and a one-line note on a real divergence you already have in front of you is worth including.
