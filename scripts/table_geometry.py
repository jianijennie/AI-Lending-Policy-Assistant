"""
Deterministic table-structure extraction from a PDF page's actual vector
line data -- built after finding that an LLM (across 6 different model/
config combinations) could not reliably tell "this cell is merged across
2 rows" apart from "merged across 3 rows" from pixels alone on a real
BFS rate table. PDF table borders are usually drawn as literal thin
filled rectangles (line segments), not just visual style -- so whether a
divider exists between two rows in a specific column is something code
can check exactly, instead of something a vision model has to guess.

This does NOT try to fully replace the LLM drafting step. It produces a
structured, human-readable report of every detected table's row/column
boundaries and merged cells, which gets fed to the LLM alongside the page
images as ground truth to read from -- turning "guess whether this is
merged" into "here's what's actually merged, transcribe accordingly."

Usage as a library: `describe_tables_on_page(page) -> str`
