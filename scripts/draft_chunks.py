Pilot: draft policy chunks directly from source PDFs using a vision-capable
LLM, instead of a human retyping tables by hand.

Why this is the "easier version" of the automation attempt that was tried
and scrapped earlier in this project: that attempt treated an LLM reading a
PDF as the risky fallback (only for scanned/checkmark-grid pages), because
the original chunking bug came from naive text-extraction scrambling a
table's column order before anyone — human or model — ever looked at it
(PyMuPDF's raw get_text() reading angle_interest_rates' multi-column layout
out of order). Rendering the page to an image and having a vision model
read it the way a human would never hits that failure mode at all — it's
reading the visual layout, not a scrambled text stream. This session's own
manual chunk audit (reading ~15 source PDFs directly and cross-checking
every number against the chunks) validated this: zero transcription errors
made that way, only pre-existing chunk errors caught.

This script does NOT touch data/chunks/ — it only ever writes to
data/chunks_draft/, and every draft must be manually reviewed against the
current chunk file before anything gets promoted. Nothing here is wired
into the live pipeline.

Usage:

"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are transcribing a lender's policy PDF into a structured markdown chunk format for a RAG knowledge base. You will be shown page images from the actual PDF.

Rules, in order of importance:
1. Transcribe numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, ages, and thresholds EXACTLY as shown in the image. Never round, average, infer, or "clean up" a number. If a table cell says "Not available" or is blank, write exactly that -- never fill in a plausible-looking number.
1b. Pages that are visually dense with several similar-looking numbers near each other (e.g. multiple "500+" / "550+" / "600+" credit-score thresholds in different sections of the same page) are exactly where transcription mistakes happen -- before writing any such number down, re-locate it in the image and re-read the specific section/heading it sits under, rather than trusting your first impression of "a number near there."
2. Every table in the source becomes a markdown table with the same rows and columns -- do not collapse, merge, or reorder rows/columns.
3. If a value is directly under one column header in the image, it belongs to that column and no other -- double-check which row/column each number came from before writing it. This is the single most important rule: a number placed under the wrong column is the exact failure mode this process exists to avoid.
4. Split the document into one chunk per distinct topic (e.g. one chunk for rates, one for eligibility criteria, one for exclusions) rather than one giant chunk -- mirror how a human would naturally divide it.
5. Each chunk must have this exact field structure, separated by a line containing only "---":

## chunk_id: <lowercase_lender>_<topic>
**source:** <lowercase lender code>
**topic:** <short topic slug>
**intent:** <one of: {', '.join(sorted(VALID_INTENTS))}>
**lenders:** <one of: {', '.join(sorted(VALID_LENDERS))}>
**borrower_profile:** <comma-separated tags, your best judgment>
**asset_class:** <comma-separated tags, your best judgment>
**doc_type:** <comma-separated tags, your best judgment>
**loan_size_band:** <comma-separated tags, your best judgment>
**answerable_questions:** <2-4 example questions this chunk answers>
**confidence:** high
**last_verified:** 2026-07-28
**trigger_words:** <comma-separated search terms a broker might use>

**Content:**

<the actual transcribed policy content, as markdown tables and prose>

6. Do not invent an "intent" or "lenders" value outside the allowed lists above -- pick the closest correct one.
7. If a fact in the source is genuinely ambiguous or contradicts another part of the same document, transcribe both readings and flag the ambiguity explicitly in prose rather than silently picking one.
8. EVERY table and section in the source must produce a chunk, with no exceptions -- including tables with unusual merged/spanning cells, tables that look hard to parse, or a table you're genuinely unsure how to read. If a table's layout is confusing (e.g. a value appears to span multiple rows or columns, or a cell's meaning is unclear), still transcribe your best reading of every cell AND add a one-line note flagging exactly which cell you're uncertain about and why. Silently omitting a table because it's difficult is the single worst failure mode here -- worse than a flagged uncertain guess, because it deletes real information instead of just risking one wrong detail. Before finishing, re-check that every distinct table/section visible across all the page images has a corresponding chunk.
9. Whenever a "DETERMINISTIC TABLE STRUCTURE" block appears after a page image, it is a ground-truth extraction from that PDF page's actual vector line data (real divider lines, or their genuine absence) -- not a guess. It tells you exactly which cells are merged and what text is in each. Use it as the authoritative source for that table's structure and values, overriding your own visual impression of the image wherever the two disagree -- your own visual read of a merge/no-merge from pixels alone is exactly the failure mode this exists to correct. A row marked "MERGED" there means that one value applies to every row listed; write it into each of those rows in your markdown table, don't collapse it into just one.

Here is one real, verified-accurate example chunk showing the exact format to produce:

{FORMAT_EXAMPLE}

Now transcribe ALL the page images you are shown into this same format. Output ONLY the chunk markdown (starting with the first "## chunk_id:" line) -- no preamble, no explanation, no markdown code fences around the whole output."""
